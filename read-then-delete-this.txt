!!! remember to first start the program by creating/setting a starting lat/long location, if you haven't started the program yet it'll be 0,0 !!!

create a home point:
./spoofgo -coordinates-add-key "home" -coordinates-add-lat 49.299273 -coordinates-add-long -123.120940
load home location:
./spoofgo -coordinates-set "home"
or list all of the currently saved locations and load one of them
./spoofgo -coordinates-list

you can spawn the api with the flag -api
by default you can visit http://localhost:8844/ to see the api and a browser based controller (which is currently very basic)
if you wish to use the browser based controller or api and not use the cli you can disable it with the flag -nogui
